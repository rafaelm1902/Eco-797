# Eco-797 - "Practicum in Empirical Analysis"
For the project of this class, I replicate and extend a section of the results
from "Trends In U.S. Wage Inequality : Revising the Revisionists‚Äù (Autor, Katz, and Kearney, 2008).
I obtain the data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS), for survey years 1964 to 2020 (covering earnings from 1963 to 2019).
The cleaning of the data, the construction of the realtive supply and wage series are according to the methods described in the data
appendix of Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008). All computations are done in stata.
